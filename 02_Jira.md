# Jira
Jira is a popular project management and issue tracking tool developed by [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/). It is widely used by software development teams to plan, track, and manage software projects. Here are some key features and functionalities of Jira:

1. **Issue Tracking**: Jira allows teams to create, update, and track issues (tasks, bugs, user stories, etc.) throughout the project lifecycle.
2. **Agile Project Management**: Jira supports agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban. It provides boards, backlogs, sprints, and other tools to help teams manage their agile workflows.
3. **Custom Workflows**: Teams can define custom workflows to match their specific processes, including custom issue types, statuses, and transitions.
4. **Reporting and Analytics**: Jira offers various reports and dashboards to help teams monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions.
5. **Integration**: Jira integrates with a wide range of other tools and services, including [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), and more.
6. **Permissions and Security**: Jira provides robust permission schemes to control access to projects, issues, and other resources.

### Keywords
1. Sprint:
   - Definition: A sprint is a fixed-duration period, usually ranging from 1 to 4 weeks, during which a specific set of tasks must be completed and prepared for        review.
   - Purpose: Sprints enable teams to divide their work into manageable segments and consistently deliver increments of value.
   - Process:
   1. Sprint Planning: Determine what can be accomplished during the sprint and outline the approach to achieve it.
   2. Daily Standups: Brief meetings to discuss progress and any obstacles encountered.
   3. Sprint Review: At the sprint's conclusion, evaluate what has been achieved.
   4. Sprint Retrospective: Reflect on the sprint to identify areas for improvement.

2. Epic:
   - An Epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks or stories.
   - It represents a significant feature or initiative that spans multiple sprints.
   - Epics help in organizing and tracking progress on larger projects or features.

3. Story:
   - It represents a single piece of work that needs to be completed within a sprint.
   - It is a user-centric requirement or feature that delivers value to the end user.
   - Stories are often written in the format of "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]."
   
4. Story Points:
   - Story Points are a unit of measure used to estimate the effort required to complete a story.
   - Instead of measuring in hours or days, story points take into account the complexity, risks, and effort involved. 
   - Teams assign story points during planning sessions to help gauge the workload for a sprint.
   
   Assignment of story points:
   - Relative Estimation Story points are assigned by comparing stories to each other. This method helps in understanding the relative effort required for each         task.
   - Common Scale A popular scale for story points is the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.).
   - Example
      A straightforward task might be assigned 1 point.
      A moderately complex task could be assigned 5 points.
      A highly complex task might be assigned 13 points.

6. Tasks:
   - A Task in Jira is a type of issue that represents a piece of work that needs to be done.
   - Tasks are typically smaller and more granular than stories and can be used for various purposes, such as technical work, research, or administrative activities.
   - Tasks can also be part of a story or an epic.
   
7. Board:
   - A Board is a visual representation of your projectâ€™s workflow.
   - It helps teams manage and track the progress of their work.
   -  Boards can be configured to follow different methodologies, such as Scrum  or Kanban.
   
   Columns on the Board: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done
   - To Do: This column contains tasks or stories that have been identified but not yet started. It represents the backlog of work that needs to be done.
   - In Progress: This column contains tasks or stories that are currently being worked on. It indicates that the work has started but is not yet complete.
   - In Review: This column is used for tasks or stories that have been completed but are awaiting review or approval. This could include code reviews, testing,        or stakeholder approval.
   - Done: This column contains tasks or stories that have been completed and approved. It indicates that the work is finished and no further action is required.

8. Issue:
   An Issue is a generic term that refers to any task, bug, feature request, or any other type of work item that needs to be tracked and managed.
   Issues are the fundamental units of work in Jira and can be categorized into different types, such as:
   - Story: A user-centric requirement or feature.
   - Bug: A problem or error in the software that needs to be fixed.
   - Task: A piece of work that needs to be done, often more granular than a story.
   - Epic: A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks or stories.
   - Sub-task: A smaller piece of work that is part of a larger issue.
     Each issue has various attributes, such as a summary, description, priority, status, assignee, and more, which help in tracking and managing the work.

9. Ticket:
   A ticket is essentially an issue that is created to track a specific request or problem reported by a user or customer. Tickets are commonly used in Jira Service Management  (formerly Jira Service Desk), 
   where they represent customer support requests, incidents, or service requests.

   Key Difference: The term "issue" is more general and can refer to any type of work item in Jira, while "ticket" is more specific to support or service          
   requests.
