# SDLC
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications. It provides a systematic approach to software development, ensuring that the final product meets the requirements and is of high quality. 

## SDLC Models 
There are several models of SDLC, each with its own approach to managing the phases of software development.
1. Waterfall Model: A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
2. V-Model: An extension of the Waterfall Model that emphasizes validation and verification at each stage.
3. Iterative Model: Develops the system through repeated cycles, allowing for incremental improvements.
4. Spiral Model: Combines iterative development with risk management, focusing on early identification and mitigation of risks.
5. Agile Model: Emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility for rapid delivery of functional software.
6. DevOps Model: Integrates development and operations to improve collaboration and automate the deployment process.
   
# What is Agile?
- Agile is a project management and software development approach that aims to be more effective.
- Agile means move quickly.
- It focuses on delivering smaller pieces of work regularly instead of one big launch.
- This allows teams to adapt to changes quickly and provide customer value faster.
- Agile is not just a methodology; it’s a mindset. Agile isn’t about following specific rituals or techniques. Instead, it’s a bunch of methods that show a dedication to quick feedback and always getting better.
- Everyone in the team works on the same level there is no hierarchy.
- They prioritize flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.
- Major companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon use Agile because of its adaptability and customer-focused approach.

### Advantages
1. Frequent delivery
2. Face to face communication with the client.
3. Frequent changes
4. Less time is required

### Disadvantages
1. Less documentation
2. Maintainance problem

### Popular Agile Frameworks
- Scrum: Focuses on fixed-length iterations called sprints.
- Kanban: Uses a visual board to manage work in progress and optimize flow. It emphasizes continuous delivery without fixed-length iterations.

## SCRUM
- One of the most popular agile methodology.
- It is a lightweight, iterative and incremental framework.
- It breaks down the development phases into stages called "Sprints".

### Key Roles
1. Product Owner: Responsible for defining the features of the product and prioritizing the backlog. The Product Owner represents the stakeholders and ensures that the team is working on the most valuable tasks.
2. Scrum Master: Facilitates the Scrum process and ensures that the team adheres to Scrum practices and principles. The Scrum Master helps remove any impediments that the team might face.
3. Development Team: A cross-functional group of professionals who do the actual work of developing the product. The team is self-organizing and decides how to accomplish the tasks in the backlog.

### Keywords
1. Backlog: The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of work for the entire project, while the Sprint Backlog is a list of work for a specific sprint.
2. Sprint: A fixed-length period during which the team works to complete a set of tasks from the Sprint Backlog.
3. Daily Scrum: A daily meeting to synchronize team efforts and plan the next 24 hours.

### Advantages
1. Freedom & Adaption
2. High-quality, low-risk product.
3. Reduce the development time up to 40%
4. Scrum customer satisfaction is very important.
5. Reviewing the current sprint before moving to new one.


### Disadvantages
1. More efficient for small team size.
2. No changes in the sprint.

# Jira
Jira is a popular project management and issue tracking tool developed by [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/). It is widely used by software development teams to plan, track, and manage software projects. Here are some key features and functionalities of Jira:

1. **Issue Tracking**: Jira allows teams to create, update, and track issues (tasks, bugs, user stories, etc.) throughout the project lifecycle.
2. **Agile Project Management**: Jira supports agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban. It provides boards, backlogs, sprints, and other tools to help teams manage their agile workflows.
3. **Custom Workflows**: Teams can define custom workflows to match their specific processes, including custom issue types, statuses, and transitions.
4. **Reporting and Analytics**: Jira offers various reports and dashboards to help teams monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions.
5. **Integration**: Jira integrates with a wide range of other tools and services, including [Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), and more.
6. **Permissions and Security**: Jira provides robust permission schemes to control access to projects, issues, and other resources.
